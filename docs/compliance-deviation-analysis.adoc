== Interpretation Guide

=== Coverage Levels

[cols="2,2,4"]
|===
| Coverage Range | Status | Action Required

| 90% - 100%
| ‚úÖ **Excellent**
| Maintain current level, monitor for upstream changes

| 70% - 89%
| ‚ö†Ô∏è **Good**

* **Modified critical tests** - Compliance risk

==== Medium Priority (Next Development Cycle)

* **Coverage 70-89%** - Good but improvable
* **Missing Process API tests** - Traversal functionality
* **Signature mismatches** - Alignment issues

==== Low Priority (Future Enhancement)

* **Coverage > 90%** - Minor improvements
* **Extra tests review** - Optimization opportunities
* **Documentation updates** - Maintenance items

== Integration Workflows

=== Development Workflow

1. **Pre-Development Analysis**
   ```bash
   pixi run compliance-deviation-fresh
   ```

2. **Review Report** - Identify implementation priorities

3. **Implement Missing Tests** - Focus on high-priority gaps

4. **Post-Implementation Validation**
   ```bash
   pixi run compliance-deviation
   ```

5. **Continuous Monitoring** - Regular analysis during development

=== CI/CD Integration

==== Automated Analysis

Add to CI/CD pipeline:
```yaml
- name: Compliance Deviation Analysis
  run: pixi run compliance-deviation-json

- name: Upload Analysis Report
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: compliance-deviation-report
    path: build/reports/compliance/
```

==== Quality Gates

Set coverage thresholds:
```bash
# Example: Fail build if coverage < 80%
python pixi-scripts/compliance_deviation_analysis.py --format json | \
jq '.coverage_analysis.coverage_percentage < 80' && exit 1
```

=== Monitoring and Maintenance

==== Regular Analysis Schedule

* **Weekly** - During active development
* **Monthly** - During maintenance phases
* **Release** - Before major releases
* **Upstream Updates** - When TinkerPop releases new versions

==== Trend Analysis

Track coverage trends over time:
```bash
# Generate timestamped reports for trend analysis
pixi run compliance-deviation-json --output "reports/compliance_$(date +%Y%m%d).json"
```

== Technical Implementation

=== Architecture

The tool consists of several key components:

1. **Test Parser** - Extracts test information from source files
2. **Upstream Fetcher** - Downloads and caches Apache TinkerPop tests
3. **Comparison Engine** - Analyzes differences and generates metrics
4. **Report Generator** - Produces formatted reports in multiple formats

=== Supported File Types

[cols="2,3,3"]
|===
| Language | File Extensions | Test Patterns

| Java
| `.java`
| `@Test` annotations, JUnit patterns

| Kotlin
| `.kt`
| `@Test` annotations, Kotlin test syntax

| Python
| `.py`
| `def test_*` methods, unittest/pytest patterns
|===

=== Caching Strategy

**Upstream Test Cache:**
* Location: `build/upstream_tests/`
* TTL: Manual refresh with `--download` flag
* Content: Apache TinkerPop test sources

**Benefits:**
* Reduced network usage
* Faster analysis execution
* Offline capability after initial download

=== Error Handling

**Graceful Degradation:**
* Network failures - Use cached upstream tests
* Parse errors - Skip problematic files with warnings
* Missing files - Continue with available tests

**Error Reporting:**
* Detailed error messages in console output
* Error summary in generated reports
* Recommendations for resolution

== Troubleshooting

=== Common Issues

==== Network Connection Problems

**Symptom:** Failed to download upstream tests
**Solution:**
```bash
# Use cached tests if available
pixi run compliance-deviation
# Or configure proxy if needed
export HTTP_PROXY=http://your-proxy:port
pixi run compliance-deviation-fresh
```

==== Parse Errors

**Symptom:** Warning messages about unparseable files
**Solution:**
* Check file encoding (should be UTF-8)
* Verify test file syntax
* Review error messages for specific issues

==== Missing Project Structure

**Symptom:** No tests found to analyze
**Solution:**
* Verify project root directory
* Check test directory structure
* Use `--project-root` parameter if needed

=== Debug Mode

Enable verbose output:
```bash
python pixi-scripts/compliance_deviation_analysis.py --format adoc --verbose
```

== Configuration

=== Customization Options

The tool can be customized by modifying `pixi-scripts/compliance_deviation_analysis.py`:

* **Test Patterns** - Regular expressions for test detection
* **File Filters** - Include/exclude patterns for file analysis
* **Report Templates** - Customize report formatting
* **Metrics Calculation** - Adjust coverage calculations

=== Environment Variables

```bash
# Custom upstream repository URL
export TINKERPOP_UPSTREAM_URL="https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/archive/refs/heads/master.zip"

# Custom cache directory
export UPSTREAM_CACHE_DIR="./cache/upstream_tests"
```

== Best Practices

=== Regular Analysis

* **Schedule regular analysis** - Weekly during development, monthly during maintenance
* **Monitor trends** - Track coverage changes over time
* **Set quality gates** - Define minimum coverage thresholds

=== Report Review

* **Focus on high-priority gaps** - Address Structure API tests first
* **Validate modifications** - Ensure changed tests maintain compliance
* **Plan incrementally** - Implement missing tests in manageable batches

=== Team Collaboration

* **Share reports** - Include in code reviews and team meetings
* **Document decisions** - Record rationale for deviations
* **Track progress** - Monitor improvement over time

== Examples

=== Basic Analysis Workflow

```bash
# 1. Generate initial analysis
pixi run compliance-deviation-html

# 2. Review HTML report in browser
open build/reports/compliance/compliance_deviation_report_*.html

# 3. Implement high-priority missing tests
# ... development work ...

# 4. Validate improvements
pixi run compliance-deviation

# 5. Compare with previous results
diff previous_report.adoc build/reports/compliance/compliance_deviation_report_*.adoc
```

=== CI/CD Pipeline Integration

```yaml
name: Compliance Analysis

                    jq -r '.coverage_analysis.coverage_percentage')
          if (( $(echo "$COVERAGE < 80" | bc -l) )); then
            echo "Coverage $COVERAGE% below threshold"
            exit 1
          fi

      - name: Upload reports
