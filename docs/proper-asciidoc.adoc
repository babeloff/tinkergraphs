= Proper AsciiDoc Guidelines

AsciiDoc is a markup language that allows you to write documents in a simple and intuitive way.
It is designed to be easy to read and write,
and it produces high-quality output that is suitable for a wide range of applications.

== Formatting Rules

=== Text Formatting

* Bold text should use single asterisks: `*bold text*`
* Do NOT use markdown-style double asterisks: `**bold text**`
* Italic text should use single underscores: `_italic text_`
* Monospace text should use single backticks: `+monospace text+`

=== Lists

* Lists should be preceded by a single blank line
* Use proper AsciiDoc list syntax, not markdown syntax
* Unordered lists use asterisks (`*`)
* Ordered lists use periods (`.`)

==== Nested Lists

* First level uses single asterisk (`*`)
* Second level uses double asterisk (`**`)
* Third level uses triple asterisk (`***`)
* Fourth level uses quadruple asterisk (`****`)

Example nested list structure:

* Main point
** Sub-point
*** Sub-sub-point
**** Fourth level point
** Another sub-point
* Another main point

=== Document Structure

* Use proper AsciiDoc headers: `=`, `==`, `===`, `====`
* Do NOT use markdown headers: `#`, `##`, `###`

=== Code Blocks

* Use AsciiDoc code block syntax with proper language specification:

[source,kotlin]
----
fun example() {
    println("Hello, World!")
}
----

* Do NOT use markdown code fences: ```

=== Well-Ventilated Writing

Documents should be well-ventilated with proper spacing and line breaks:

* Sentences should begin on a new line
* Long sentences (over 80 characters) should be split into multiple lines,
  splitting (in order of preference) on: semicolons, commas, and predicates
* Use blank lines to separate sections and improve readability
* Each list item should be on its own line

=== Common Migration Issues

When migrating from markdown to AsciiDoc:

* Replace `**bold**` with `*bold*`
* Replace ```` code blocks with proper `[source,language]` and `----` delimiters
* Replace `#` headers with `=` headers
* Ensure nested lists use `**`, `***` syntax instead of indentation
* Remove any HTML-style formatting

=== Examples

==== Good AsciiDoc:

```
= Document Title

== Section Header

This is a paragraph with proper line breaks.
Long sentences are split appropriately for readability.

* First item
** Nested item
** Another nested item
* Second item

*Bold text* and _italic text_ are properly formatted.
```

==== Bad AsciiDoc (markdown-style):

```
# Document Title

## Section Header

This is a paragraph that goes on for a very long time without any line breaks which makes it hard to read and maintain.

* First item
  * Nested item (wrong indentation)
  * Another nested item
* Second item

**Bold text** and *italic text* are improperly formatted.
```

== Document Organization

=== File Structure

* Use descriptive filenames with proper extensions: `.adoc`
* Follow consistent naming conventions: `phase3.6.2-feature-name.adoc`
* Place related documents in appropriate directories (`changelog`, `evaluation`, etc.)

=== Document Metadata

* Always include a clear document title using `= Title`
* Add overview sections for context and scope
* Include status information when relevant
* Provide creation/modification dates for tracking

=== Cross-References

* Use proper AsciiDoc cross-reference syntax
* Link to related documents using relative paths
* Maintain consistent link formats throughout project documentation

== Best Practices

=== Content Organization

* Start with an overview or executive summary
* Use logical section hierarchy with proper headers
* Group related information under appropriate sections
* End with conclusions or next steps when applicable

=== Writing Style

* Write in active voice when possible
* Use consistent terminology throughout documents
* Define acronyms and technical terms on first use
* Keep paragraphs focused on single topics

=== Technical Documentation

* Include code examples using proper syntax highlighting
* Provide context for technical decisions and implementations
* Document both successful outcomes and lessons learned
* Reference external resources and specifications appropriately

=== Review and Maintenance

* Ensure all cross-references remain valid
* Update status information as work progresses
* Remove outdated information promptly
* Maintain consistency with project-wide documentation standards
