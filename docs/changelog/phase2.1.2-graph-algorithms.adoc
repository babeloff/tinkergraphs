== Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of **Phase 2.1.2: Add graph algorithms support**, which adds fundamental graph algorithms as extension functions on the `Graph` interface. This implementation provides a solid foundation for graph analysis and traversal operations in TinkerGraph.

== Implementation Scope

=== Core Algorithms Implemented

==== Graph Traversal Algorithms

* **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
  - Level-by-level graph traversal
  - Lazy sequence implementation for memory efficiency
  - O(V + E) time complexity
  - Primary use: shortest path finding in unweighted graphs

* **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
  - Deep exploration with backtracking
  - Stack-based iterative implementation
  - O(V + E) time complexity
  - Primary use: cycle detection, topological sorting

==== Pathfinding Algorithms

* **Shortest Path (Unweighted)**
  - BFS-based shortest path between two vertices
  - Path reconstruction with parent tracking
  - Returns null for disconnected vertices
  - O(V + E) time complexity

* **Vertices at Distance**
  - Find all vertices at exact distance from start vertex
  - Efficient level-by-level exploration
  - Useful for neighborhood analysis

==== Connectivity Analysis

* **Connected Components**
  - Identifies all maximal connected subgraphs
  - DFS-based component discovery
  - Returns list of vertex sets representing components
  - O(V + E) time complexity

* **Graph Connectivity Check**
  - Determines if graph has single connected component

  - Detects presence of cycles in undirected graphs
  - DFS with parent tracking to avoid false positives
  - Handles self-loops correctly
  - O(V + E) time complexity

  - Longest shortest path between any vertex pair
  - Computationally expensive O(V³) operation
  - Returns -1 for disconnected graphs
  - Useful for network analysis

== Technical Implementation Details

=== Architecture Decisions

==== Extension Functions Approach
All algorithms are implemented as extension functions on the `Graph` interface, providing:

* **Clean API**: Natural integration with existing Graph methods
* **Non-intrusive Design**: No modification of core Graph classes required
* **Modularity**: Algorithms can be optionally imported/used
* **Extensibility**: Easy to add new algorithms following the same pattern

==== Iterator Utilization
The implementation leverages TinkerGraph's efficient iterator system:

* **TinkerVertexIterator**: For vertex enumeration and filtering
* **TinkerEdgeIterator**: For neighbor traversal with direction support
* **Memory Efficiency**: Lazy evaluation prevents unnecessary object creation
* **Performance**: Optimized for TinkerGraph's internal structure

==== Undirected Graph Semantics
All algorithms treat the graph as undirected by using `Direction.BOTH`:

* **Consistency**: Uniform behavior across all algorithms
* **Flexibility**: Can be adapted for directed graphs by changing direction parameters
* **Correctness**: Proper cycle detection for undirected graphs with parent tracking

=== Data Structures and Optimizations

==== Memory Management
* **Visited Sets**: Use vertex IDs instead of vertex objects to reduce memory footprint
* **Sequence Returns**: BFS and DFS return lazy sequences for streaming processing
* **Early Termination**: Algorithms terminate as soon as results are found (e.g., cycle detection)

==== Multiplatform Compatibility
* **Pure Kotlin**: No platform-specific dependencies
* **Standard Collections**: Uses only Kotlin standard library collections
* **JVM/JS/Native**: Full compatibility across all target platforms
