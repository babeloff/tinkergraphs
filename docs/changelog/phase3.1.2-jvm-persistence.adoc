data class TransactionContext(
    val id: Long,
    val timestamp: String,
    val operation: String,
    val format: String,
    val fileName: String,
    val metadata: Map<String, String> = emptyMap(),
    var completed: Boolean = false
)
----

Detailed metadata tracking for each persisted graph:

[source,kotlin]
----
data class PersistenceMetadata(
    val version: String = "1.0.0",
    val createdAt: String,
    val lastModified: String,
    val format: String,
    val compressed: Boolean = false,
    val vertexCount: Int = 0,
    val edgeCount: Int = 0,
