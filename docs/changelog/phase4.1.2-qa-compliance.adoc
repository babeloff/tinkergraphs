The systematic approach to compliance testing ensures long-term maintainability and provides clear documentation for future TinkerPop version synchronization.

*Current Status:* Phase 2 substantially completed with both Structure and Process API compliance tests implemented and passing.
Core TinkerPop compatibility has been successfully validated across vertex/edge operations, property management, and graph traversal patterns.

*Next Immediate Priority:* Proceed to Phase 3 (Integration & Validation) focusing on CI/CD integration, cross-platform verification, and comprehensive documentation.
Address minor test runner filtering issue and prepare for broader TinkerPop ecosystem integration.

*Updated Recommendation: ADVANCE TO PHASE 3* with Phase 2 core objectives successfully achieved.
The comprehensive compliance test suite (Structure + Process APIs) with full provenance tracking establishes TinkerGraphs as a legitimate TinkerPop-compliant implementation ready for production validation and ecosystem integration.
