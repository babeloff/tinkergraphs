== Overview

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the advanced graph algorithms implemented in TinkerGraph. These algorithms extend the basic graph functionality with sophisticated analysis capabilities including weighted pathfinding, minimum spanning trees, strongly connected components, and connectivity analysis.

All algorithms are implemented as extension functions on the `Graph` interface and support multiplatform deployment across JVM, JavaScript, and Native platforms.

== Implementation Philosophy

The advanced algorithms follow these key principles:

* **Extension Functions**: All algorithms are implemented as `Graph` extensions for clean API integration
* **Multiplatform Compatibility**: Pure Kotlin implementation works across all target platforms
* **Performance Optimization**: Algorithms leverage TinkerGraph's efficient iterator implementations
* **Correctness**: Each algorithm includes comprehensive test coverage and validation
* **Documentation**: All algorithms include Wikipedia references and complexity analysis

== Weighted Graph Algorithms

=== Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm

==== Purpose

Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path between two vertices in a weighted graph where all edge weights are non-negative. It explores vertices in order of their distance from the source vertex.

==== Function Signature

[source,kotlin]
----
fun Graph.dijkstraShortestPath(
    from: Vertex,
    to: Vertex,
    weightProperty: String = "weight",
    direction: Direction = Direction.OUT
): WeightedPath?
----

==== Parameters

* `from`: The starting vertex
* `to`: The target vertex
* `weightProperty`: The edge property containing weights (default: "weight")
* `direction`: Edge traversal direction (default: Direction.OUT for directed graphs)

==== Return Value

Returns a `WeightedPath` object containing:

* `vertices`: List of vertices forming the shortest path
* `totalWeight`: Total weight of the path

Returns `null` if no path exists between the vertices.

==== Time Complexity

* **Time**: O((V + E) log V) with binary heap
* **Space**: O(V)

Where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

==== Usage Examples

[source,kotlin]
----
val graph = TinkerGraph.open()
val v1 = graph.addVertex("name", "A")
val v2 = graph.addVertex("name", "B")
val v3 = graph.addVertex("name", "C")

// Add weighted edges
val e1 = v1.addEdge("road", v2)
e1.property("weight", 5.0)
val e2 = v2.addEdge("road", v3)
e2.property("weight", 3.0)

// Find shortest path
val path = graph.dijkstraShortestPath(v1, v3)
path?.let {
    println("Path: ${it.vertices.map { v -> v.value<String>("name") }}")
    println("Total distance: ${it.totalWeight}")
}
// Output: Path: [A, B, C], Total distance: 8.0
----

==== Algorithm Details

The implementation uses a priority queue approach:

1. Initialize distances to infinity except source (distance 0)
2. Add all vertices to unvisited set
3. While unvisited vertices remain:
   - Select vertex with minimum distance
   - If target reached, reconstruct path
   - Update distances to neighbors
   - Mark vertex as visited

== Directed Graph Algorithms

=== Topological Sorting

==== Purpose

Topological sorting produces a linear ordering of vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge (u, v), vertex u appears before v in the ordering.

==== Function Signature

[source,kotlin]
----
fun Graph.topologicalSort(direction: Direction = Direction.OUT): List<Vertex>?
----

==== Parameters

* `direction`: Edge traversal direction (default: Direction.OUT)

==== Return Value

Returns a list of vertices in topological order, or `null` if the graph contains cycles.

==== Time Complexity

* **Time**: O(V + E)
* **Space**: O(V)

==== Usage Examples

[source,kotlin]
----
val graph = TinkerGraph.open()
val task1 = graph.addVertex("task", "compile")
val task2 = graph.addVertex("task", "test")
val task3 = graph.addVertex("task", "package")
val task4 = graph.addVertex("task", "deploy")

// Define dependencies
task1.addEdge("dependsOn", task2)  // test depends on compile
task2.addEdge("dependsOn", task3)  // package depends on test
task3.addEdge("dependsOn", task4)  // deploy depends on package

val order = graph.topologicalSort()
order?.let { tasks ->
    println("Execution order: ${tasks.map { it.value<String>("task") }}")
}
// Output: Execution order: [compile, test, package, deploy]
----

==== Algorithm Details

Uses Kahn's algorithm:

1. Calculate in-degree for each vertex
2. Add vertices with zero in-degree to queue
3. While queue is not empty:
   - Remove vertex from queue and add to result
   - For each neighbor, decrease in-degree
   - If neighbor's in-degree becomes zero, add to queue
4. If result contains all vertices, return it; otherwise graph has cycles

=== Strongly Connected Components (Tarjan's Algorithm)

==== Purpose

Finds all strongly connected components in a directed graph. A strongly connected component is a maximal set of vertices such that there is a directed path from each vertex to every other vertex in the component.

==== Function Signature

[source,kotlin]
----
fun Graph.tarjanStronglyConnectedComponents(direction: Direction = Direction.OUT): List<Set<Vertex>>
----

==== Parameters

* `direction`: Edge traversal direction (default: Direction.OUT)

==== Return Value

Returns a list of sets, where each set contains the vertices of one strongly connected component.

==== Time Complexity

* **Time**: O(V + E)
* **Space**: O(V)

==== Usage Examples

[source,kotlin]
----
val graph = TinkerGraph.open()
val v1 = graph.addVertex("id", 1)
val v2 = graph.addVertex("id", 2)
val v3 = graph.addVertex("id", 3)
val v4 = graph.addVertex("id", 4)

// Create strongly connected component
v1.addEdge("connects", v2)
v2.addEdge("connects", v3)
v3.addEdge("connects", v1)  // Forms SCC: {v1, v2, v3}
v3.addEdge("connects", v4)  // v4 is separate component

val components = graph.tarjanStronglyConnectedComponents()
println("Found ${components.size} strongly connected components")
components.forEachIndexed { index, component ->
    println("Component ${index + 1}: ${component.map { it.value<Int>("id") }}")
}
// Output:
// Found 2 strongly connected components
// Component 1: [1, 2, 3]
// Component 2: [4]
----

==== Algorithm Details

Tarjan's algorithm uses DFS with additional bookkeeping:

1. Maintain discovery time and low-link value for each vertex
2. Use stack to keep track of current path
3. For each unvisited vertex, perform DFS:
   - Assign discovery time and low-link value
   - Push vertex onto stack
   - For each neighbor:
     - If unvisited, recurse and update low-link
     - If on stack, update low-link with discovery time
   - If vertex is root of SCC (low-link equals discovery time):
     - Pop vertices from stack until current vertex to form SCC

== Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms

=== Kruskal's Algorithm

==== Purpose

Finds the minimum spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph. A minimum spanning tree connects all vertices with the minimum total edge weight.

==== Function Signature

[source,kotlin]
----
fun Graph.kruskalMinimumSpanningTree(weightProperty: String = "weight"): Set<Edge>
----

==== Parameters

* `weightProperty`: Edge property containing weights (default: "weight")

==== Return Value

Returns a set of edges forming the minimum spanning tree.

==== Time Complexity

* **Time**: O(E log E) due to sorting edges
* **Space**: O(V)

==== Usage Examples

[source,kotlin]
----
val graph = TinkerGraph.open()
val v1 = graph.addVertex("city", "A")
val v2 = graph.addVertex("city", "B")
val v3 = graph.addVertex("city", "C")
val v4 = graph.addVertex("city", "D")

// Add weighted roads
val roads = listOf(
    v1.addEdge("road", v2).also { it.property("weight", 4.0) },
    v1.addEdge("road", v3).also { it.property("weight", 2.0) },
    v2.addEdge("road", v3).also { it.property("weight", 1.0) },
    v2.addEdge("road", v4).also { it.property("weight", 5.0) },
    v3.addEdge("road", v4).also { it.property("weight", 3.0) }
)

val mst = graph.kruskalMinimumSpanningTree()
val totalWeight = mst.sumOf { it.value<Double>("weight") }
println("MST contains ${mst.size} edges with total weight: $totalWeight")
// Output: MST contains 3 edges with total weight: 6.0
----

==== Algorithm Details

Kruskal's algorithm uses a greedy approach with union-find:

1. Sort all edges by weight in ascending order
2. Initialize union-find data structure
3. For each edge in sorted order:
   - If edge connects different components, add to MST
   - Union the components
   - Stop when MST has V-1 edges

val articulationPoints = graph.articulationPoints()
println("Articulation points: ${articulationPoints.map { it.value<Int>("id") }}")
