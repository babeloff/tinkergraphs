== Overview

This roadmap outlines the development plan for
implementing Apache TinkerPop's TinkerGraph as a Kotlin Multiplatform project.
The goal is to create a complete graph database implementation that can target
JVM, JavaScript (Node.js/Browser), and Native platforms
while maintaining API compatibility with the original Java implementation.

== Project Structure

=== Current State
- [x] Basic project structure with Kotlin Multiplatform setup
- [x] Core interfaces (Graph, Element, Vertex, Edge, Property, VertexProperty)
- [x] Direction enum and basic structures
- [x] TinkerElement base class with property management
- [x] Basic TinkerGraph class structure
